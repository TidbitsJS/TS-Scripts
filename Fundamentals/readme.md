### Boolean

Named constant that represents logical values `true` and `false`

### Void

The Void type is used as function return type.

Represents functions that do no return a value

### Null

Keyword - `null`

### Undefined

When we declare empty variables, then undefined type is assigned to them until we assign a value to them

Keyword - `undefined`

### Any

The `any` type allows us to assign literally "any" particular value to that variable.

> The `any` type should really be used when we don't actually know what type is actually coming back to us.

inferred type - i.e TypeScript infer the type for us. If we don't supply a type, it will be of type `any` by default.

Keyword - `any`

### Array

To store values of different data types sequentially.

### Tuple

A tuple is a TypeScript type that works like an array with some special considerations -

- The number of elements of the array is fixed,
- The type of the elements is known
- The type of the elements of the array need not be the same

### Enum

Collection of related values that can be numbers or strings as a set of named constants.

Enums are preprocessed and are not tested at compile time or runtime.

Keyword - `enum`
