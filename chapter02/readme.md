## Points

- `any` is a special TypeScript type– it does not exist in JavaScript. It accepts any value of any
  type, and is thus a top type, encompassing all other types.
- TypeScript sets `any` as the default type for any value or parameter that is not explicitly typed or can’t be inferred.
- The browser’s JavaScript runtime can’t run TypeScript

> Note that after the compile step you lose all type safety when you run your code: it’s plain JavaScript once it hits browsers.

- TypeScript not only erases all types but also takes modern-day JavaScript features and transpiles them to older ECMAScript versions.
- TypeScript that generates JavaScript is called emitting

### Type Annotations

Declaring type annotations for variables and functions:

```typescript
function addVAT(price: number, vat: number = 0.2): number {
  return price * (1 + vat);
}
```

#

### noEmit flag

```bash
tsc --noEmit
```

- If this flag isn’t set (the default) we always get JavaScript – even when type checks fail.
- If we want to make sure we don’t get any emitted JavaScript output, set noEmitOnError to true in tsconfig.json.

#

### any

any is the default type if we neither specify a type nor let TypeScript infer one.

```typescript
let deliveryAddress; // deliveryAddress is any
```

Explicitly specify the type through an annotation

```typescript
// deliveryAddress is of type any
let deliveryAddress: any = "421 Smashing Hill, 90210";
```

> any can be anything: it’s a top type and, therefore, all other types are part of any .

- Since any can be anything, any also allows us to access properties that might not be there.

> any is a wildcard!

#### Why does something like any even exist?

- due to the nature of JavaScript.

- In JavaScript, you are not bound to a type, and values from any type can appear in your variables and properties.

- any reflects JavaScript’s overarching flexibility

```typescript
// theObject is an object we don’t have a type for,
// but we know exactly what
// we are doing!
(theObject as any).firstLetter.toUppercase();
```

If you want to make sure you don’t have any somewhere in your code you don’t expect it to be, set the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to `true`.

TypeScript will then make sure that you either assign values to correctly infer types or, in the case of `any`, make sure that you explicitly annotate or cast to `any`.

#

### Typing

- The moment we annotate using the colon syntax, the name is of the type we annotate. We call this technique left-hand typing, as the typing happens before (to the left of) the equals sign.

- Leaving out type annotations and working first with type inference is called right-hand typing.

```typescript
let deliveryAddresses = [
  "421 Smashing Hill, 90210",
  "221b Paw-ker Street",
  "4347 Whiskers-ia Lane",
];

// Type of deliveryAddresses is string[]
let deliveryAddresses: string[] = [];

// OK
deliveryAddresses.push("421 Smashing Hill, 90210");
// Not OK! 2 is not a string
deliveryAddresses.push(2000);
```

- With left-hand typing, you can think a lot about your types before you start coding the rest.

- Right-hand typing allows you to make up types as you go, which might be a little bit more JavaScript-y.

#

#### Type Guards

Perform run-time checks on types, just like the typeof operator makes sure we’re dealing with a number at this point.

#### Control flow analysis

Type guards are used to trigger control flow analysis in TypeScript.

TypeScript can analyze the flow of your program to provide the right types for the next steps.

#

- any is the supertype of all types.

- string is a subtype of any.

- Every value of string can be assigned to its supertype any , but not every value of any can be assigned to its subtype string .

- The same concept applies to classes and objects. HTML Element is the supertype of all HTML elements in the DOM. HTMLAnchorElement is a subtype of HTMLElement. Every HTMLAnchorElement can be assigned to type HTML Element, but not every value of HTMLElement can be assigned to an HTMLAnchorElement .

#

### Unknown

- unknown is compatible with every type in TypeScript.

- It's also a top type.

- any is both carefree and careless, putting type safety into the developer’s hands; unknown requires much more caution and concern.

#

### Composite Types

- virtually any combination of property names and other types, both primitive types and additional composite types.

- Objects are composite types.

```typescript
const book = {
  title: "Form Design Patterns by Adam Silver",
  price: 32.77,
  vat: 0.19,
  stock: 1000,
  description: "A practical book on accessibility and forms",
};

// To define a type for this object, we can use the type alias syntax:
type Article = {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  vat: number;
  stock: number;
  description: string;
};
```

Annotating the type of book:

```typescript
const book: Article = {
  title: "Form Design Patterns by Adam Silver",
  price: 32.77,
  vat: 0.19,
  stock: 1000,
  description: "A practical book on accessibility and forms",
};
```

#

### Structural Typing and Excess Property Checks

If we assign a value with properties not in the specified type, TypeScript displays an error

```typescript
// Property 'rating' is not allowed
const movie: Article = {
  title: "Helvetica",
  price: 6.66,
  vat: 0.19,
  stock: 1000,
  description: "90 minutes of gushing about Helvetica",
  rating: 5,
};
```

However, this isn’t the case when we define the value elsewhere:

```typescript
// Property 'rating' is not allowed
const movBackup = {
  title: "Helvetica",
  price: 6.66,
  vat: 0.19,
  stock: 1000,
  description: "90 minutes of gushing about Helvetica",
  rating: 5,
};

const movie: Article = movBackup; // Totally OK!
```

_**Why?**_

TypeScript is a structural type system.

This means that as long as the defined properties of a type are available in an object, the structural contract is fulfilled.

When assigning movBackup to movie of type Article , all relevant properties match: title, price, vat, stock, and description . The extraneous – or excess – rating property is swept under the rug. Literally!

If we look at the autocompletion features that VS Code gives us as soon as we assigned movBackup to movie , we see that rating is not available anymore.

This doesn’t mean that these properties aren’t there at runtime. They are! But during development, our tooling envi-
ronment will make sure we only use the properties that are defined by the type.

We could get values from anywhere, and those values could change over time, but our contract still only cares about the right types of a certain set of properties. This makes our application still valid and typesafe but allows us to be flexible in other parts of our app.

This is also true if we have two different types with a similar enough structure to fulfill the contract:

```typescript
type ShopItem = {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  vat: number;
  stock: number;
  description: string;
  rating: number;
};
const shopitem = {
  title: "Helvetica",
  price: 6.66,
  vat: 0.19,
  stock: 1000,
  description: "90 minutes of gushing about Helvetica",
  rating: 5,
};

const movie: Article = shopitem; // Totally OK!
```

_**But why does a direct value assignment after a type annotation cause an error?**_

This feature is called an excess property check.

Because TypeScript is kind to us as structures could change across our application, it will point us to things that might be deliberate mistakes.

Assigning a value right after a type annotation that doesn’t completely match is most likely an unintentional error.

```typescript
const missingProperties = {
  title: "Helvetica",
  price: 6.66,
};

// Boom! This breaks
const anotherMovie: Article = missingProperties;
```

The structural contract is not fulfilled.

#

### Objects as Parameters

We can also use our custom defined types as parameters in functions:

```typescript
function createArticleElement(article: Article): string {
  const title = article.title;
  const price = addVAT(article.price, article.vat);
  return `<h2>Buy ${title} for ${price}</h2>`;
}
```

Inline object type with only the properties we expect:

```typescript
function createArticleElement(article: {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  vat: number;
}): string {
  const title = article.title;
  const price = addVAT(article.price, article.vat);
  return `<h2>Buy ${title} for ${price}</h2>`;
}
```

Passing elements of type Article still would work:

```typescript
const movie: Article = {
  title: "Helvetica",
  price: 6.66,
  vat: 0.19,
  stock: 1000,
  description: "90 minutes of gushing about Helvetica",
};

createArticleElement(movie);
```

The structural contract is still fulfilled.

But just like it is with direct value assignments, passing an object with too many properties directly to a function will trigger excess property checks:

```typescript
// Boom! rating is one property too many
createArticleElement({
  title: "Design Systems by Alla Kholmatova",
  price: 20,
  vat: 0.19,
  rating: 5,
});
```

#

### Object Type Tool Belt

1. typeof

Object types can be very long. Sometimes we work with data structures that are deeply nested and have tons of properties. Look at the object that defines a default order in our online shop:

```typescript
const defaultOrder = {
  articles: [
    {
      price: 1200.5,
      vat: 0.2,
      title: "Macbook Air Refurbished - 2013",
    },
    {
      price: 9,
      vat: 0,
      title: "I feel smashing subscription",
    },
  ],
  customer: {
    name: "Fritz Furball",
    address: {
      city: "Smashing Hill",
      zip: "90210",
      street: "Whisker-ia Lane",
      number: "1337",
    },
    dateOfBirth: new Date(2006, 9, 1),
  },
};
```

This object is a bit complex! We could define the type in one sitting:

```typescript
type Order = {
  articles: {
    price: number;
    vat: number;
    title: number;
  }[];
  customer: {
    name: string;
    address: {
      city: string;
      zip: string;
      street: string;
      number: string;
    };
    dateOfBirth: Date;
  };
};
```

Or we could create lots of smaller types:

```typescript
type ArticleStub = {
  price: number;
  vat: number;
  title: string;
};

type Address = {
  city: string;
  zip: string;
  street: string;
  number: string;
};

type Customer = {
  name: string;
  address: Address;
  dateOfBirth: Date;
};

type Order = {
  articles: ArticleStub[];
  customer: Customer;
};
```

or mix of both!

In either case, we end up either maintaining a lot of types or creating unwieldy types. All we wanted was to get a quick type for a data structure in order to have better autocompletion and type safety in our methods.

In TypeScript’s type system, the typeof operator takes any object (or function, or constant) and extracts the shape of it:

```typescript
type Order = typeof defaultOrder;
```

This gives us a type we can use anywhere in our code:

```typescript
/**
 * Checks if all our orders have articles
 */
function checkOrders(orders: Order[]) {
  let valid = true;
  for (let order of orders) {
    valid = valid && order.articles.length > 0;
  }
  return valid;
}
```

The moment you update your defaultOrder object, the type Order gets updated as well!

#

### Optional Properties

A question mark after a property’s name declares that property optional. This means they can be available, but they could also be missing.

```typescript
type Article = {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  vat: number;
  stock?: number;
  description?: string;
};
```

We have to check if they are available:

```typescript
unction isArticleInStock(article: Article) {
  // this check is necessary to make sure
  // the optional property exists
  if(article.stock) {
    return article.stock > 0
  }
  return false
}
```

#

### Typing Classes

TypeScript can be seen as a programming language that erases to JavaScript. On top of JavaScript code that exists and is valid, we add another layer of type information that disappears once the compiler has run.

JavaScript features classes as an alternate syntactic form for the constructor function and prototype pattern.

Here’s a class in pure JavaScript that applies a discount to one of our articles:

```typescript
class Discount {
  isPercentage;
  amount;

  constructor(isPercentage, amount) {
    this.isPercentage = isPercentage;
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  apply(article) {
    if (this.isPercentage) {
      article.price = article.price - article.price * this.amount;
    } else {
      article.price = article.price - this.amount;
    }
  }
}

// A discount that shaves off 10 EUR
const discount = new Discount(false, 10);
discount.apply({
  price: 39,
  vat: 0.2,
  title: "Form Design Patterns",
});
```

With a few little extra type annotations, we can have proper tooling and can make sure that we construct correct objects:

```typescript
class Discount {
  isPercentage: boolean;
  amount: number;

  constructor(isPercentage: boolean, amount: number) {
    this.isPercentage = isPercentage;
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  apply(article: Article) {
    if (this.isPercentage) {
      article.price = article.price - article.price * this.amount;
    } else {
      article.price = article.price - this.amount;
    }
  }
}

let discount: Discount = new Discount(true, 0.2);
```

Classes have two parts:

1. The constructor function

   We defined our constructor function to take a Boolean isPercentage, and a number for the amount we want to shave off. The moment we call new Discount(true, 0.2), we invoke the constructor function.

2. Prototype

   This is everything around the constructor function: two fields (isPercentage, amount) and a function to apply the discount to an article.

The prototype defines the shape of the object that is returned by invoking the constructor.

Now that we know the shape, we can even assign regularly generated objects to a variable of type Discount.

```typescript
let allProductsTwentyBucks: Discount = {
  isPercentage: false,
  amount: 20,
  apply(article) {
    article.price = 20;
  },
};
```

This is a valid Discount, as the shape is intact. But it changes the semantics of the Discount class tremendously.

We can define an object type, and create a new Discount object via a constructor:

```typescript
type DiscountType = {
  isPercentage: boolean;
  amount: number;
  apply(article: Article): void;
};

let disco: DiscountType = new Discount(true, 0.2);
```

One main feature of classes is that they are extensible. You can take an existing class and extend it, overriding and adding features.

```typescript
/**
 * This class always gives 20 %, but only if
 * the price is not higher than 40 EUR
 */
class TwentyPercentDiscount extends Discount {
  // No special constructor
  constructor() {
    // But we call the super constructor of
    // Discount
    super(true, 0.2);
  }

  apply(article: Article) {
    if (article.price <= 40) {
      super.apply(article);
    }
  }
}
```

We created a discount class that always applies 20%, but only if the article’s price is lower than 40 Euro. In this special case, TwentyPercentDiscount is of the same shape as Discount, which means that their type declaration is interchangeable:

```typescript
let disco1: Discount = new TwentyPercentDiscount(); // OK
let disco2: TwentyPercentDiscount = new Discount(true, 0.3); // OK! Semantics changed!
```

Validation feature to TwentyPercentDiscount:

```typescript
class TwentyPercentDiscount extends Discount {
  constructor() {
    super(true, 0.2);
  }

  apply(article: Article) {
    if (this.isValidForDiscount(article)) {
      super.apply(article);
    }
  }

  isValidForDiscount(article: Article) {
    return article.price <= 40;
  }
}

let disco1: Discount = new TwentyPercentDiscount(); // Still OK!

// Error! We miss the `isValidForDiscount`
// method
let disco2: TwentyPercentDiscount = new Discount(true, 0.3);
```
