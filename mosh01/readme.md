### Summary

- Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it includes all the built-in types in JavaScript(eg number, string, boolean, object, etc) as well as additional types(eg any, unknown, never, enum, tuple, etc).
- In TypeScript, we set the type of our variables by annotating them.
- The **any** type can represent any kind of value. It's something we should avoid as much as possible because it defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in first place. A variable of type **any** can take any kind of value!
- Tuples are fixed-length arrays where each element has a specific type. We often use them for representing two or three related values.
- Enums represent a list of related constants

### Compiler Options

| Option             | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| noImplicitAny      | When enabled, the compiler will warn you about variables that are inferred with the any type. Youâ€™ll then have to explicitly annotate them with any if you have a reason to do so. |
| noImplicitReturns  | When enabled, the compiler will check all code paths in a function to ensure they return a value.                                                                                  |
| noUnusedLocals     | When enabled, the compiler will report unused local variables.                                                                                                                     |
| noUnusedParameters | When enabled, the compiler will report unused parameters.                                                                                                                          |
