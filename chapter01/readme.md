## Points

- TypeScript points out potential errors before your code hits the production environment
- TypeScript provides code analysis for JavaScript
- Under the hood, TypeScript is already active in VS Code
- By adding `//@ts-check` to the top of your file, you can get TypeScript to check your code for errors.

### Features

1. Type Check

   - Making sure you use the correct names for the things you want to use.
   - No more typos, no more wrong spellings or mixed up terms.

2. Type Inference

   - The moment you assign a value to a variable, TypeScript tries to infer the type from the assignment.

3. Semantic Checks

   - Differentiate between multiple types of the same basic type.
